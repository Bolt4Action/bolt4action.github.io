            <h2>The Power of Internalizing and Outsourcing Cognition</h2>
            <p>Internalization via Externalization:
                ([[Writing is thinking, The Power of Externalization]])</p>
                <ul>
                <li>When you consume knowledge, It can either:<ul>
                <li>Get loaded into your short-term memory, Forgetting it soon after. </li>
                <li>Get loaded into your long-term memory, But in an unorganized way. </li>
                <li>Get loaded in your long-term memory in an organized way. </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>One benefit of Externalization is that when you write your ideas in concrete form, That helps you </li>
                <li><p>In order to offload by internalization, You have to consciously repeat the action until it is internalized in a habit, Or consciously grapple with a thought long enough that it becomes intuitive (Ex: Problem-Solving, Decision-Making and Language  Learning).</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Some of your Intuition is so deeply rooted, That it requires <em>External Hooks &amp; Pointers</em> so you can <em>Externalize</em> this knowledge and deal with it in concrete form, Organizing it then it can be internalized again. </p>
                <ul>
                <li>This helps in dealing with your biases and [[Challenging the Hidden Assumption]] you have.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
